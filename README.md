# Next.js 14 Template

## Minimal Node version
Since __`Next`__ has been updated to **v14**, Node engine\`s version requirement is `v18.7+`.

If you don\`t want to use `Next 14` and `Node.js 18.7+`, use `next-13` [branch instead](https://github.com/XenoPOMP/next-template/tree/next-13).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
